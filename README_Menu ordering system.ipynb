    "__Describe the project__ \n",
    "__If you are doing a predefined project choice, explain how you implemented that specific choice. This description should match what you submitted as your project proposal. (4 points)__\n",
    "My intention was to make a meal ordering system to improve the customer experience at a local restaurant. \n",
    "I planned to reduce wait periods and ordering mistakes. \n",
    "I tried to achieve these by giving direct operation options and by implementing interactive and secure ways to collect and store customer orders. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Explains in a few sentences why you selected this project, and if you learned what you had hoped to learn by doing this project (from your proposal). Explain. (4 points)__\n",
    "I selected this project based on my experience at one of my favorite local restaurants back home in Nigeria. \n",
    "They had great food but there were a lot of challenges while trying to buy food during the rush-hour period. \n",
    "It is a small family-owned (and ran) business that I believe would do so much more with better resources. \n",
    "I hope one day I can develop my code well enough for them to try out.\n",
    "Thanks to this project, I did learn how to manage basic processes programmatically.\n",
    "However, I did not get to make a pseudocode for it the way I wanted. \n",
    "I believe there is plenty room for improvement on my approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What you would do differently if you were to have an opportunity to redo this project and why. (4 points)__\n",
    "I would give myself more time to try multiple approaches to the entire project. \n",
    "This would enable me to see how different variable types can improve data/input collection, storage, and manipulation. \n",
    "I would also be able to implement features beyond the instructions that I imagined trying as I worked on it. All for a better user/customer experience. Some of these features would be adding pagination and a search function to the meal menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How to run your project. (4 points)__\n",
    "This project is a menu ordering system for a business named: OKO IYA LAMALA KITCHEN.\n",
    "You don’t need any additional document to use the program. \n",
    "While in use, the user is to give a valid input based on the instructions displayed.\n",
    "The user is to select their meal, give quantity and they may choose to provide their name for the receipt.\n",
    "The user can make meal selections from the menu options (there’s a main menu and a specials menu). \n",
    "__Please note that__, the specials menu is not populated from the start of the run and will be unavailable if a user tries to access it.\n",
    "It will be available when the manager populates it from the manager mode. The manager mode can make changes to the menu options and delete an entry from a customer order. I advise that you see the available menu options before making changes as you need t\n",
    "\n",
    "__To use the manager mode, enter 4 form the customer menu and follow the instructions.__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Username is __manager__\n",
    "Passcode is __shalom__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Was the project challenging in the way you expected? What did you overcome? (4 points)__\n",
    "The project was very challenging; with each step, there was a new question of how to handle possible errors, or multiple user approaches.  \n",
    "This project helped me face my fear of functions, while loops and condition statements. I was able to practice choosing better conditions to control the loops based on the multiple case scenarios they were to handle. \n",
    "I also practiced implementation of new modules that I found like getpass and datetime.\n",
    "My biggest achievement/fulfilment was seeing that I could handle longer codes. \n",
    "My biggest lesson was seeing how handling projects as a piecemeal could be good but it also has its constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cited sources, appropriate acknowledgements. Explain how each source applied to your project. (5 points)__\n",
