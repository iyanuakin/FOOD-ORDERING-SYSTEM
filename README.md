# FOOD-ORDERING-SYSTEM

BY: IYANUOLUWA AKINYANJU

- __Project Description__ 

My intention was to code for a meal ordering system to improve the customer experience at a local Nigerian restaurant. 
I planned to reduce wait periods and ordering mistakes. 
I tried to achieve these by giving direct operation options and by implementing interactive and secure ways to collect and store customer orders.

- __Aim and Lesson(s) Learned__

I selected this project based on my experience at one of my favorite local restaurants back home in Nigeria. 
They had great food but there were a lot of challenges while trying to buy food during the rush-hour period. 
It is a small family-owned (and ran) business that I believe would do so much more with better resources. 
I hope one day I can develop my code well enough for them to try out. 
Thanks to this project, I did learn how to manage basic processes programmatically. 
However, I did not get to make a pseudocode for it the way I wanted. I believe there is plenty room for improvement on my approach.

- __What I would do differently/improve when I get a chance and why__

I would try other approaches to the project. This would enable me to see how different variable types can improve data/input collection, storage, and manipulation. 
I would like to provide additional features like pagination and a search function to the meal menu. All for a better user/customer experience.

- __How to run the program.__

This is a meal ordering system for a business named: OKO IYA'LAMALA KITCHEN.
You don’t need any additional document to use the program just copy the code and run in your command line or IDE.
While in use, the user is to give a valid input based on the instructions displayed.
The user is to select their meal, give quantity and they may choose to provide their name for the receipt.
The user can make meal selections from the menu options (there’s a main menu and a specials menu). 
__Please note that__, the specials menu is not populated from the start of the run and will be unavailable if a user tries to access it.
It will be available after the manager populates it from the manager mode. The manager can make changes to the menu options and delete an entry from a customer order. 
I advise that you see the available menu options before making changes as you need the meal name to do so.
To use the manager mode, enter 4 form the customer menu and follow the instructions.

- __Challenges and Feats__ 

Thanks to my very little experience, I found this project very challenging; with each step, there was a new question of how to handle possible errors, or multiple user approaches.
This project helped me face my fear of functions, while loops and condition statements. 
I was able to practice choosing better conditions to control the loops based on the multiple case scenarios they were to handle. 
I also practiced implementation of new modules that I found like getpass and datetime. 

- My biggest achievement/fulfilment was seeing that I could handle longer codes. 

- My biggest lesson was seeing how handling projects as a piecemeal could be good but it also has its constraints.

YOUTUBE: From __Corey Schafer’s Channel__ (Great Resource), I learned how to use:
• The getpass module (for my manager mode access). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-gEQdGVXbk&t=2005s

• Datetime module (used for receipt) and string formatting (for better styled output.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTX3IwquFkc

• Using zip to combine and iterate multiple lists (used for storing and displaying orders). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-gEQdGVXbk&t=2005s

• Populating dictionaries with input() (Used to collect new menu entries from manager) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daefaLgNkw0

YOUTUBE: From the following, I got a better understanding of operational flow of similar meal ordering programs and a better understanding of how to connect functions.
